\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:sec001}

This document~\cite{francisco_maria_calisto_2019_2639038} aims to describe the protocol and guidelines of the presented information. We perform a set of tests in the scope of \hyperlink{}{v0.0.0-alpha}, \hyperlink{}{v0.0.0-alpha} and \hyperlink{}{v0.0.0-alpha} versions from {\it \hyperlink{}{Prototype Link A}}, {\it \hyperlink{}{Prototype Link B}} and {\it \hyperlink{}{Prototype Link C}} prototypes, respectively. The repositories are part of the \hyperlink{}{Some Name Link} project using traditional devices (mouse and keyboard). The goal of the test is to compare each prototype, measuring the user performance, efficiency and efficacy metrics. The sessions will be recorded via video on a computer and using an interaction record, while triggering event tools. It is guaranteed the confidentiality of the recordings, which will be used only for academic purpose.
