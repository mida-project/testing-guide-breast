\section{Description}
\label{sec:sec002}

This document describes our test plan for conducting our user tests during the development of the \hyperlink{}{Project Name Link} project and systems. The goals of the user testing phases include establishing a baseline of participant performance, establishing and validating participant performance measures, and identifying potential design concerns to be addressed in order to improve the efficiency, productivity, and end-user satisfaction within the development and introduction of \textit{Scope} methods inside the participants environment room, between others, for some scope, or more precisely, for some domain.

\hfill

The user test objectives are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item To determine design inconsistencies and issues within the UI and content areas;
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Navigation Errors};
\item \textbf{Presentation Errors};
\item \textbf{Control Usage Problems};
\end{enumerate}
\item Exercise the prototype under controlled test conditions with representative users;
\item Establish baseline user performance and user-satisfaction levels of the user interface for future usability evaluations;
\end{enumerate}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Potential sources of error may include: (a) \textbf{Navigation Errors:} failure to locate functions, excessive keystrokes to complete a function, failure to follow recommended screen flow; (b) \textbf{Presentation Errors:} failure to locate and properly act upon desired information in screens, selection errors due to labeling ambiguities; and (c) \textbf{Control Usage Problems:} improper toolbar or entry field usage. Data will be used to access whether usability goals regarding an effective, efficient, and well-received user interface have been achieved.
