\section{Tasks}
\label{sec:sec007}

During our user tests, we need to ask participants to provide a subjective assessment of their experience using our \textit{Scope}. There are several widely used questionnaires giving us different prons-and-cons. However, in most cases, a \hyperlink{https://www.nngroup.com/articles/keep-online-surveys-short/}{single question instrument}~\cite{sauro201210} is the right method for a quantitative usability testing. By taking less time and effort to answer, participants are pursuing to this phase after task, while it is minimally disruptive.
